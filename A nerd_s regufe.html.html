    <p>D&D stands for Dungeons & Dragons, a tabletop role-playing game where players create characters and embark on adventures in a fictional world. The game is typically played with a group of friends and guided by a Dungeon Master who creates the story and controls the non-player characters and the world around the players. The game involves rolling dice to determine the success or failure of actions, and players can choose to take different paths and make decisions that affect the outcome of the story.</p>
